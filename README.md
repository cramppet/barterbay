Our Freshmen design sequence project called "BarterBay"

##What is BarterBay

BarterBay is an application which allows for users to trade for items with other users of the BarterBay system.
This is accomplished through chatting services which are provided within the application.

Note: There is also a server-side component of BarterBay which must be set up in order to use BaterBay successfully.
This is not included in this repository.
