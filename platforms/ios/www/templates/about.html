        <p>
          BarterBay was an application which started out as a class project at Drexel University.
          The project was a part of the College of Computing and Informatics Freshmen Design
          sequence and was a 2 quarter project.

        <p>
          The purpose of BarterBay is to allow people in the same general area to trade for items
          that they have on hand for things they would like to have. An example use case would be
          two students that could mutually exchange textbooks to the benefit of both.
